    "Despite Baylor & TCU having more success last season, Texas A&M is the premiere program in the state.\n\n" + 

    "Its more than just wins & losses. A&M is set to lead the nation in attendance this year. Thats big. Our fanbase is massive. We also just signed a multi million dollar deal with Adidas. A&M plays on national TV each week, sometimes on CBS, which translates into a lot of eyeballs & TV ratings making them a national brand.\n\n"+

    "Then there is recruiting. We continue to dominate recruiting rankings which validates what our program has become & shows that recruits want to be here. I feel like recruiting is HUGE when it comes to the influence & footprint of a program, because it either validates or rejects what your program is. The fact that we are doing so well in recruiting PROVES that our program is a big 1 that the best want to be associated with. If Baylor/TCU were truly marquee programs they would be pulling in the states top recruits.\n\n" + 

    "Baylor/TCU may have had 11/12 win seasons, conference titles, & played in a big bowl, but they arent A&M. They dont have the fanbase, they dont have the attendance, they dont play on the big networks & have the TV ratings & arent big TV draws which makes them a regional brand at best.\n\n" + 

    "I would compare it to the iPhone. Texas A&M is the iPhone: a big brand. We always hear about how new phones are “iPhone Killers” but never kill the iPhone. While these iPhone killers may be more impressive pieces of technology that are more powerful & functional, the iPhone still outsells them big time. Baylor & TCU are those iPhone killers. They may be better on the field, but in the big picture, adding in factors like attendance, recruiting & TV ratings, they dont stack up. Texas A&M is the brand name.\n\n" + 

    "I’d rather win 8 games every year & be tops in the nation in attendance/recruiting/national recognition, than win 11 games & have limited appeal. Its more about wins/losses, its about the programs footprint as a whole.\n\n"
